# 🧠 Alzheimer's Prediction

A deep learning–based project for **early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD)** using MRI image data and explainable AI (XAI) techniques.  
The system predicts the cognitive condition of a patient and classifies them into stages for better understanding and medical interpretation.

---

## 📋 Project Overview
Alzheimer’s Disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory and cognition.  
This project builds an intelligent model that predicts the stage of Alzheimer’s and provides **explainable visual insights** to help clinicians interpret model decisions.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🧩 **Deep Learning Model** for MRI-based Alzheimer’s classification  
- 🔍 **Explainable AI (XAI)** visualization for each prediction  
- 🌐 **Web Interface** for easy patient image upload and results display  
- 🧠 **Four-Class Prediction:**
  - **Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)**
  - **Cognitively Normal (CN)**
  - **Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI)**
  - **Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI)**
- 📦 Organized modules for training, inference, and deployment
